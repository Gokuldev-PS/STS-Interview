# STS-Interview - Array/List Question

### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def predict_the_function(arr):
      ms= cs = arr[0]
      for num in arr[1:]:
        cs = max(num, cs + num)
        ms = max(ms, cs)
      return ms
    numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -3, 2, -1]
    result = predict_the_function(numbers)
    print(result)
     ```

### Questions to the Candidate
- Explain the purpose of this Python code, including the function predict_the_function.
- Identify any potential issues or improvements in the code
- Modify the code to handle the potential issues.

### Possible/Expected Answers
Explain the purpose of this Python code:
Expected Answer:
The code defines a function predict_the_function(arr) that calculates the maximum sum of a continous subarray within the given array . It iterates through the array and maintains two variables, cs and ms, to keep track of the current sum of the subarray and the maximum sum encountered so far.
Identify any potential issues or improvements in the code:
Expected Answer:
The code assumes that the input array (arr) is non-empty. It may be a good idea to add a check for an empty array at the beginning of the function to handle this case gracefully.
The code works for arrays with all positive numbers but may not handle arrays with all negative numbers correctly. It's essential to consider such cases.
Modify the code to handle a case where all numbers in the array are negative:
Expected Answer:
Introduce a check at the beginning of the find_max_sum_subarray function to handle the case when all numbers in the array are negative. In this case, return the maximum negative number in the array
